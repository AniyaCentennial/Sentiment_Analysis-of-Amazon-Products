# Amazon Electronics Product Sentiment Analysis

This project is centered on analyzing customer reviews for Amazon's electronic products to extract valuable insights into customer sentiment (Positive, Neutral, or Negative). The analysis focuses solely on Amazon data and incorporates both machine learning and visualization techniques.

Key highlights of the project:

Data Preparation:

Text reviews were cleaned by removing special characters, numbers, and stopwords, and applying lemmatization.
Sentiments were categorized as Positive, Neutral, or Negative and encoded numerically for model training.
Modeling and Prediction:

Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were used to classify sentiment.
Advanced techniques like fine-tuning the BERT model significantly improved prediction accuracy by leveraging contextual understanding of customer reviews.
Visualization with Tableau:

Interactive Dashboards were created in Tableau to visualize customer sentiment distribution.
Key insights like the proportions of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments and word clouds for frequently used words in reviews were displayed interactively.
Results and Impact:

The sentiment analysis provided clear insights into customer satisfaction for Amazon's electronic products.
These insights can help businesses identify customer pain points and make data-driven decisions to improve products and services.
